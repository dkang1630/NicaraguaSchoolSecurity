# Nicaragua School Security Project

<h2>Description</h2>
The Beyond the Light Project has reached numerous energy-impoverished communities in Nicaragua, providing them with a sustainable and affordable answer to their energy needs. The schools which have been helped because of this project have been given a Solar kit including a 25W to 100W solar panel as well as a sealed lead acid battery, housing, and connectors. All these components are vulnerable to theft and need protection. This project aims to create an external system for the security of the solar panels on the school roofs and a school security system to prevent theft of the battery, housing, and connectors.


1. **Alarm Activation:**
   - Activate the alarm by entering a 6-digit password using buttons labeled 1 (left) and 2 (right).

2. **Password Confirmation:**
   - Upon entering the correct password, a single blink of the indicator light confirms the authentication.

3. **Reed Switch Timer:**
   - A predetermined interval (approx. 1 minute, programmable) is available before the reed switch activates.

4. **Buzzer Warning:**
   - In the event of an attempted break-in, the buzzer provides an initial warning for a specific time before the main alarm activates.

5. **Persistent Alarm:**
   - Even if the door is closed after the warning, the alarm persists until the correct password is entered.

6. **Deactivation Process:**
   - Correct password input triggers an LED blink, deactivating the alarm and putting it in standby mode.

A Coding Note:
- To ensure stability, the reed switch's state is averaged to counteract noise-induced fluctuations, preventing unwarranted horn activation.
